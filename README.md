# Welcome to my very first public project, a personnal trading automation website

## The purpose 

To make my trading automatic and to be able to learn how to use NuxtJS, TradingView API (as I was a fan of PinescriptV5 at the time) and a broker (KuCoin) API to specifically trade CyptoFutures to be able to profit from long + short selling at a good price.

## The technologies I used

I am using the NuxtJS Framework. The Frontside is in VueJS, the serverside is in JavaScript using nitroJS.
The trading caculation and data analysis + trading instruments are using the Pinescript V5 scripting language by TradingView.
I'm using TradingView API to get the signals on when to open and close a trading. 
I'm then sendings signals to my broker, KuCoin, on my account using their API.

## What works and what doesn't
Since the last time I used it, taking an order works, automatic orders works.
__Safeguards didn't work.__ 
I can't test it again right now since I stopped paying my subscription on TradingView.

## The next step

- [ ] I plan on making a youtube video to show you how it works. It is planned between now and the end of november 2024. My apologies if it takes longer.

## What it needs

- [ ] Unit Tests
- [ ] CI/CD
- [ ] tradeReception.js needs to be reworked for better readability.
- [ ] More and better written safeguards if the user loses money.
- [ ] Make the safeguards graphic
- [ ] Have a visual cue of how the current strategy in play is performing.

## What I am doing right now
Taking online courses to replace TradingView by my own alternative.
I'm also learning how to use Machine Learning to improve my trades and automations.
My motivation comes from the biggest drawback : I didn't see how to backtest my trades for more than a week on TradingView. I'd like to be able to make backtests on 10 to 20 years to have a better chance of using a good trading strategy.
I'll also replace NuxtJS by Python. I really liked using Pandas and Jupyter Notebooks.

Remember : this is not financial advice, just a way to learn how to use new tools. Trading is a risky activity and could cost you your money, your good temper, your house and if unlucky your favorite laptop.
